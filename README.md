# 6006CEM_2021s1_8571021_PS

Building an image recognition machine learning algorithm known as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Created using Keras API with tensorflow on Jupyter Notebook on the CIFAR10 dataset by Krizhevsky, A.

Link to CIFAR10 dataset : https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html 

Dataset can be downloaded using load.data() command as shown in code

To run:
Install Anaconda from, https://www.anaconda.com/

Open Jupyter Notebook

On the terminal run:

---conda install python=*3.7 (Instead of defaulted 3.8 at time writing)
  
---conda install Tensorflow
  
---conda install Keras
  
Run code as shown (Run seperated blocks of code in individual cells)

Note: The code can be run on any python system, not just Jupyter notebook, If you are not using anaconda, run the pip equivalent of the commands on your system. Other packages will also need to be installed : numpy, sklearn, matplotlib and seaborn.

Note: Currently Tensorflow does not support Python 3.8 and above at time of writing so ensure you have the correct version of python.
